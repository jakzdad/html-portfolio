  <div class="aboutMe">
      <p>Hello! My name is Carlos, and I have dedicated 26 years of my career to the information technology sector at
        Travelers. Throughout this time, I've developed a profound appreciation for working with computers and the integral
        role
        they play in business operations. My journey in IT has been both rewarding and enlightening, allowing me to explore
        various technological advancements. Recently, I've decided to channel my passion into a new directionâ€”web development.
        This transition marks an exciting chapter in my professional life, where I am eager to apply my extensive IT
        experience
        to the world of development.</p>
      <p>To equip myself for this new venture, I completed Udemy's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp course, earning a certificate
        that signifies my commitment to mastering web development. Through this training, I have become proficient in HTML,
        CSS,
        SASS, and JavaScript, enabling me to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I am enthusiastic about
        leveraging
        these skills to craft innovative solutions and contribute to the digital landscape. Thank you for visiting my page,
        and
        I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
